# Automatically Creating Localizations with Azure Translator

This repository provides a comprehensive guide on how to automatically create localizations using Azure Translator. It includes the setup of an ASP.NET Core MVC application, which serves as a platform to display localizations, and a console application that automates the generation of localization and resource files. The guide walks through configuring shared localization in the MVC application and integrating Azure Translator into a console application to streamline the translation process.

By automating the creation of localization files, developers can significantly reduce manual work and manage multi-language support more efficiently. This repository aims to simplify the localization workflow, allowing developers to focus on building high-quality applications while Azure Translator handles the automatic generation of resource files and translations.
